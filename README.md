## Introduction
Anyone who plays the game of golf wants to hit the ball far off the tee.  Golf club manufacturers are always aggressively developing and marketing drivers that can hit the ball longer and straighter, while still within the limits set by governing bodies like the USGA (United States Golf Association) and R&A (Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews).  Our belief is that drivers are the most “improvable” golf club through technology, irons being second, and last being the clubs used inside of 100 yards.  The clubs used for shots inside of 100 yards (let’s call these short game clubs) are typically wedges (gap wedges, sand wedges, lob wedges) and putters.  

We want to know if the constant focus on driver technology has left the short-game relatively untouched.  We’ll do this by looking at the stats of the best players in the world, the PGA Tour, across 2010-2018, and compare their performance off the tee with their short game performance.

   * `Hypothesis - Driving distance and accuracy has improved over the years, with an accompanying increase in short-game performance (<100 yards including putting)`

   * `Null Hypothesis - Driving distance and accuracy has improved over the years, while short-game performance (<100 yards including putting) has remained the same`
